# What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
    https://jkru3.github.io/movie-search/

# What API did you use and why?
    Being my first JavaScript application, I wanted to chose an API that would be relatively straightforward to implement and easy to find resources on. The API of TMDb fit this criteria for me.

# What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.
    At the moment, all this app can do is search.


# Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
    I kept text sizes and colors consistent to make sure that they could be easily read.


# How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
    In keeping this app simple, I also avoided using color designs that could be confusing to color-blind individuals.


# If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
    In the coming days I'd like to work on a build that has a sort function and a filter function based on criteria such as date released, rating, or title, along with an option to filter out adult-rated cards.

    In the coming weeks, I'll focus on implementing greater accessibility features, such as dyslexia-font or enlarged font. I'd also like to experiment with adding voice-over functionality on each individual card.

    If I could make further changes to this project, I would like to add a sortable "favorites" section using a Linked List. This way, users could create a wishlist and add there favorite movies to it.
